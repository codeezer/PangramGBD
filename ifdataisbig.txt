If you had a scenario where the input data is a large dataset (As in the case of BIG data). How would you solve the above problem of checking for pangram and counting pangram occurrence?


>>  I can't say actual solution to this. But I think following might be the good solutions:
    
    1. Increase computational power by Parallel processing 
    2. Use more optimized library of python like re
    3. Use different big data platforms 
    4. Use nosql db for easy and fast access
